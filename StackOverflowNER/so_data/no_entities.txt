stream	O
and	O
converting	O
it	O
to	O
UTF-8	O

Note	O

You	O
should	O
imbue	O
the	O

before	O
it	O

opened	O

Different	O
implementations	O

you	O
imbue	O
the	O

it	O

that	O
i	O

a	O

What	O

Why	O
do	O
most	O
of	O
its	O
methods	O
have	O
a	O
closure	O
?	O

I	O

the	O

between	O

I	O
just	O

I	O
use	O

In	O
some	O
cases	O
the	O
patterns	O
are	O
interchangeable	O
,	O
however	O
:	O

Using	O
a	O
closure	O
is	O
the	O
simplest	O
solution	O
for	O
simple	O
cases	O

Using	O
a	O
delegate	O
is	O
common	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
complex	O
communication	O
between	O
two	O
objects	O
.	O

One	O
delegate	O
can	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
many	O
closures	O

You	O
have	O
to	O
use	O
notifications	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
multiple	O
observers	O
or	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O

will	O
be	O
observing	O

You	O
might	O
be	O
asking	O
yourself	O
why	O
we	O
are	O
using	O
closures	O
for	O
simple	O
cases	O
and	O
not	O
delegates	O
or	O
notifications	O
.	O

The	O
answer	O
is	O
that	O
closures	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
lightweight	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
easy	O
to	O
create	O
and	O
they	O
positively	O
affect	O
your	O
code	O
quality	O
.	O

Let	O
's	O
consider	O
a	O
completion	O
callback	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
decide	O
to	O
use	O
a	O
notification	O
,	O
you	O
need	O
another	O
method	O
that	O
will	O
handle	O
that	O
notification	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
is	O
valid	O
for	O
delegates	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
need	O
some	O
context	O
(	O
e.g	O
.	O
the	O
parameters	O
that	O
triggered	O
the	O
actions	O
)	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
save	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
property	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
a	O
closure	O
can	O
be	O
created	O
inline	O
.	O

That	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
code	O
that	O
triggers	O
the	O
action	O
and	O
handles	O
its	O
result	O
is	O
at	O
one	O
place	O
.	O

This	O
really	O
simplifies	O
the	O
structure	O
of	O
your	O
code	O
.	O

Also	O
note	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
closure	O
needs	O
some	O
context	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
capture	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
need	O

create	O
an	O
additional	O
property	O
